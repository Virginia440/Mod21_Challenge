## Technologies Required


Remix IDE - Open source web and desktop application. It fosters a fast development cycle and has a rich set of plugins with intuitive GUIs. 

Solidity - Create the smart contract and implement the joints saving application to work with ether.

Remix IDE - Write and edit solidity code to create the contracts

MetaMask - Use digital wallet and a gateway for the Ethereum blockchain.

Ganache - This is a tool that allows us to quickly set up a local blockchain, which we can use to test and develop smart contracts.

OpenZeppelin - OpenZeppelin library provides a wide variety of contracts that are related to the ERC-20 token standard.



## Overview of the analysis

* Purpose of the analysis

Assuming the role of a lead project manager for Martian Aerospace Agency, develop a monetary system for the new Mars colony. Base this new monetary system on blockchain technology, and to define a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin. (“Kasei” means “Mars” in Japanese.) KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. Launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.

## Project Steps
1. Create the KaseiCoin token contract.

2. Create the KaseiCoin crowdsale contract.

3. Create the KaseiCoin deployer contract.

4. Perform a real-world, pre-production test of your crowdsale. In order to do so, you will deploy the crowdsale to a local blockchain by using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache.

5. Record a short video or take several screenshots that show the deployed contract in action.
